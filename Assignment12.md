| Relational Databases (RDBMS)                 |  non-relational or distributed database   |
|  table based databases	                 |  collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores   |

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- complex queries.

### Give a real world example.
- MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- For the type of data to be stored.

### Give a real world example.
- MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- NoSQL database.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?
- NoSQL databases.

### What does SQL stand for?
- Structured Query Language.

### What is a realational database?
- Database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports SQL .

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- SQL structure, tables.

### What is a ‘schema’?
- Collection of database objects linked with a particular database username. The username that I am talking about is called the Schema owner, or more appropriately the owner of the related group of objects.

### What is a NoSQL database?
- Unstructured

### Howo does it work?
- use collections instead of tables , collections have documents (can use different  structures / no schema applied).

### What is inside of a Mongo database?
- collections, documents , many different data that are not applied to schema or relations.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- MongoDB is more flexible, because you store your data where ever you want, you don't have to follow a schema,(have less relations merging and super fast and efficient query ).

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- Having duplicated data.
