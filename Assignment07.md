## Who is Roy Fielding?
- Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style.

## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
-  Because they weren't designed to be used like that.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What does a GET do?
- GET: get data by URL (source).

## What does a POST do?
- POST: one system adds something to another system.

## What does PUT do? 
- PUT: one system replaces something in another system.

## What does PATCH do?
