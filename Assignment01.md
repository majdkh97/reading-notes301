## Component Based Architecture

### What is a component?
- Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.

### What are the charactistics of a component?
- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
- Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
- Ease of deployment
- Reduced cost
- Ease of development
- Reusable 
- Reliability
