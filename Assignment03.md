## <array.map()> returns a new array with the same length.
- const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
- const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
- console.log(doubled);
- this will log [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] to the console.

**Each list item needs a unique KEY.**

**why do we use keys ;because they help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.**

## The Spread Operator

### The Spread operator lets you expand an iterable like an object, string, or array into its elements while the Rest operator does the inverse by reducing a set of elements into one array.
### like it can help in :Copying an array ,Concatenating or combining arrays, Using Math functions, Using an array as arguments, and so many other things (check references for more information).


## Passing Functions between Components
**In react we can pass functions through components using state and adding methods to the class.**
